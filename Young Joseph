=='''Background'''==
[https://jojo.fandom.com/wiki/Joseph_Joestar Joseph Joestar] (ジョセフ・ジョースター ''Josefu Jōsutā'') is the main protagonist of [https://jojo.fandom.com/wiki/Battle_Tendency ''Jojo's Bizarre Adventure Part 2: Battle Tendency''] and an ally in Part 3 and 4. 

=='''Description'''==
(In-game description) Originally Kars, don't expect Super4 quality. I don't have the time i use to have to work on n, only got 30 minutes a day compared to like the 4 hours i originally had so don't expect things to go smoothly. hermit purple isn't coming lol, custom run anim will be coming eventually.

Gameplay Description:

Young Joseph is one of the best specs for deadly combos; you are able to use your Super1 to trap your opponents and spray gunfire upon them once they return to you.

Additionally, YJ's Crossbow is unblcokable and also stuns upon impact; making it even more deadly.
